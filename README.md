# AutoVanilla

## What is AutoVanilla?

AutoVanilla is a Minecraft Forge Mod, made for the versions 1.18, 1.19, and 1.20.
It adds 'Auto' versions of the Smithing Table, Anvil, Enchantment Table, and Grindstone.

All of these require Forge Energy to run, which can be generated through other mods, such as [Mekanism](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism)

## What Happened to AutoSmithingTable?

AutoVanilla is a rewrite of AutoSmithingTable, but also includes the additional features described previously.
AutoVanilla replaces AutoSmithingTable, with better sided inputs, user interface, and aims to provide better 
overall user experience.
